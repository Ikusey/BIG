<p>Recently, mobile internet browsing has spiked in activity thanks to the further development of mobile devices based on a 2018 study on 2017’s mobile vs desktop statistics by Eric Enge of Perficient Digital. The ways we see fit to browse the internet are advancing whether it be from a mobile app or via a website, the question is which of the two is better. It's an important topic to consider when running a business as it's a way to get what you’re doing out to consumers quickly. Responsive websites are a fairly standard method of website design for businesses as they are able to fit different devices ranging from desktop computers to tablets to smartphones and they are much cheaper and faster to make than mobile apps. While there aren’t many downsides to either one, when choosing one over the other responsive websites can be slower and not as convenient to have for consumers as they rely on having an internet connection.</p>

<p>However, mobile devices generally require an internet connection to start with but many features can be available offline, but of course that's dependent on the application. Thanks to a good amount of the data being installed onto a device with mobile apps the speed compared to a website is significantly greater. Another great feature of mobile apps if the integration with the device itself, having the possibility of communicating with other apps or phone features like notifications, contacts, etc. Having a well made app usually increases its popularity which in turn increases the number of users downloading and using the app.</p>

<p>Regarding both methods, the better of the two really depends on what is needed. If a budget is tight or some online presence is required quickly, a responsive website is an easier way to go. If neither is an issue then a mobile app, if its well done, can be a powerful tool.
