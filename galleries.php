<p>HTML galleries can give your website more character, giving a user something to interact with thats colorful and more plainly says what your website is about. Making an HTML gallery is a fairly simple process, requiring a little experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript if you plan on making your own type pf gallery, however its best to just use premade code. </p>

<p>There are different types of galleries, ones that specifically use jQuery to help supplement with its easy to use library, there are lightbox galleries that use JavaScript (more recently redesigned for jQuery, there are CSS galleries that are completely written in CSS, wordpress based galleries and similar ones; a majority of these galleries are jQuery based. Whatever the case is, to set up a gallery simply requires you to download the required files and follow the base instructions. Most likely the gallery you choose will give you code or a link into your webpage so the gallery shows up. </p>

<p>For example, I chose to use the <em>“WOW Slider”</em> as recommended by a Hongkiat article on 20 different responsive image galleries and slideshows. It is a jQuery based slider a library of different image transitions that you can customize as you wish. It also has a feature to either export you gallery as an html file, insert it into an already made html document, or upload the gallery to a webpage/website. </p>

<p>After setting up the gallery, the HTML on the HTML and CSS side of the code, the images should be sized accordingly to the webpage, as even though it may be ok to keep their original sizes for the gallery, they will look different on the web page itself. </p>
